    Scissoring Tests

Tests:
 + dEQP-GLES2.functional.scissor.*
 + dEQP-GLES3.functional.scissor.*

Includes:
 + Primitives
   - Points
   - Lines
   - Triangles
 + Clears (including GLES 3 only ones)
 + Framebuffer blits (GLES 3)
 + Scissor configurations
   - Enclosing rendered area
   - Enclosed by rendered area (if applicable)
   - Partially containing rendered area
   - (Partially) outside render target


Excludes:
 + Blits to/from multiple buffers
 + Partially clipped points

Description:

This test set compares images rendered by a reference software
rasterizer to images rendered by the target.

Primitives are tested one at a time with the scissor area in one of the
above configurations.

Color clears are tested by clearing to a color with the scissor test disabled
and then clearing to a different color with the scissor test enabled in each
of the above scissor area configurations.

Depth & stencil clears are tested by clearing only the scissor area to a value
that will permit a subsequent primitive to be rendered in the presence of
depth/stencil testing.

Framebuffer blitting is tested like clearing but with the last clear replaced
by a blit.
